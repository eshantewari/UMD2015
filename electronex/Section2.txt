  * What causes the strange behavior in the transverse momentum plots?  
  * Looking at the pseudorapidity plot, what can you say about the CMS detector?
  
  The CMS detector best measures particles with 0 rapidity and can measure particles with rapidities ranging from roughly
  -2.5 to 2.5
  
  * How could these distributions inform our selection of electrons?
